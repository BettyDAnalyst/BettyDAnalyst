ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Elizabeth "Lady Bhie" Ekenimoh, preferably Bhetty or Lady Bhie.
- Technical Business Analyst. BA Trainer. Career Clarity Coach.
- I bridge business goals with code, crafting clear docs and data-driven solutions. Lover of workflows, APIs, and neat SQL queries.


I am a Tech-savvy Business Analyst who speaks fluent backend and SQL. 
I bridge the gap between business goals and code, translating complex problems into clear, actionable solutions. 
Lover of clean docs, killer user stories, and SQL queries that actually make sense. 

On a mission to build smarter systems and smarter teams â€” one API spec at a time.

When Iâ€™m not mapping workflows or reviewing PRDs, youâ€™ll find me plotting my next portfolio project or geeking out over the perfect process flow.

Letâ€™s make business and tech play nice.
